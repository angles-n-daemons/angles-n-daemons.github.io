&lt;p>I recently read an article on &lt;a href="https://www.zumsteg.net/2022/07/05/unchecked-ab-testing-destroys-everything-it-touches/">hacker news&lt;/a> highlighting some of the anti-patterns of experimentation and it got me thinking about an idea that I’ve had bouncing around in my head for some time. The article begins to unwind some of the common risks with experimentation, which generally include ignoring the long term effects of experiments and only measuring part of what matters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wanna get better? Spend less time rubbernecking.</title><link>https://abudlightlime.com/posts/20220703-rubberneck-debugging/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 16:26:50 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://abudlightlime.com/posts/20220703-rubberneck-debugging/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="what-is-rubberneck-debugging">What is rubberneck debugging?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Rubberneck debugging is something I see a lot of high achieving engineers fall trap to. Put simply, it’s the eagerness one might feel to respond to urgent inquiries in a forum like slack. I find that it tends to stifle the engineers growth, as well as diminishes the opportunities that newer and more junior engineers have to engage in public discussion.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-does-it-look-like">What does it look like?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I think we&amp;rsquo;ve all been in this situation before. You&amp;rsquo;re pushing a PR for a small chunk of work that you tackled in the morning and you go to slack to clear your inbox before starting the next chunk of work.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
