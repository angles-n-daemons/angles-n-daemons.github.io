&lt;p>Last night I dreamt that I had been working at an orphanage in Latin America. Like most charities in the world its mission was to achieve something of good, but just like everything in practice it felt imperfect, unright, greedy from the inside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One came upon the orphanage by driving deep into the jungle; taking the back roads, dirt-paved roads, gravel low-ways and hilly drive-ways until a rectangular, dirt parking lot, surrounded by green and brown trees was reached. A small path was cut out in the corner of this driveway with a sign indicating the destination in question at its mouth.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
