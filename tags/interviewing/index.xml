The take home exercise is an interviewing practice that&amp;rsquo;s existed for a while. It&amp;rsquo;s been around for a while in the form of a case study, and I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it personally as an open ended development exercise. If completed well, it provides a great deal of insight into how the candidate works. Like any practice though, it isn&amp;rsquo;t without its drawbacks. Aside from the issues companies face like cheating[1], take home interviews can artificially limit the prospective talent pool, in addition to self-select for dishonest candidates.</description></item></channel></rss>
