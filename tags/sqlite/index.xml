Hopefully by the end of the exercise we should be able to run this new function in our main file:
# main.py ... + def test_file_end_to_end(): + # create the pagers for both the old and new dbs + old_db_pager = Pager(&amp;#39;test.db&amp;#39;) + new_db_pager = Pager(&amp;#39;generated.db&amp;#39;) + + # read in the schema page + schema_page = old_db_pager.</description></item><item><title>popSQL part 1: reading the sqlite database file</title><link>https://abudlightlime.com/posts/20230805-popsql-1-reading-db-pages/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2023 10:26:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://abudlightlime.com/posts/20230805-popsql-1-reading-db-pages/</guid><description>Reading the database files My approach this time will be to start from the absolute bottom of the system, the file format. I chose this as a starting place because it&amp;rsquo;s easy to test in addition to being well documented. From there I&amp;rsquo;ll design a close-enough-to the source set of abstractions which are unit tested fairly comprehsively.
Before we write any code, let&amp;rsquo;s look at the directory for the code this section.</description></item><item><title>popSQL part 0: a DB education through reverse-engineering</title><link>https://abudlightlime.com/posts/20230803-popsql-0-recreating-sqlite/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Aug 2023 11:41:42 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://abudlightlime.com/posts/20230803-popsql-0-recreating-sqlite/</guid><description>A liking for database systems Databases have long been a special interest of mine. Since taking CS 445 Information Systems at UMass, I&amp;rsquo;ve held a unique curiosity for how databases were used and how they worked under the hood. I found topics like relational algebra fascinating, and I always enjoyed how clean SQL felt. I distinctly remember how enjoyable it was leafing through Michael Stonebraker&amp;rsquo;s Red Book and over time I developed a decent understanding about how to design, interact with and debug production databases.</description></item></channel></rss>
