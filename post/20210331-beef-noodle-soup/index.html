长岛牛肉面
simple long island beef noodle soup
(serves 9 people or 40 hungry cats)

ingredients:
 - 8 quarts water
 - 6 lbs beef bones
 - 2-3 lbs beef chuck
 - 6 tbsp sugar (optional)
 - baby bok choy (or other leafy vegetable)
 - 6 cloves garlic
 - 1 ginger root guy sliced into business cards
 - 5 tomatoes
 - 2 stalks scallions
 - five spice powder
 - crushed red chili powder
 - soy sauce
 - flour noodles (or spaghetti)

instructions:
_broth &amp; meat_
1. Bring 8 quarts of water to a boil. Blanche and rinse the beef bones / chuck in batches to remove any impurities. Discard the dirty water.
2. Bring 8 more quarts of water and optionally the sugar to a boil. Add the beef bones and chuck in addition to two quartered tomatoes, one stalk of scallions, the garlic and ginger.
3. Boil on medium low for 2 hours, then pull the bones and chuck out and prepare / set aside meat.
  3a. For the bones, try to pull the tendons and ligaments off in addition to any meat that's attached.
  3b. Cut the chuck into 1.5-2&quot; wide cubes. They should be larger than bite sized, but movable with chop sticks.
4. Return the bones only to the broth and continue to boil for at least another 6 hours. Add water as needed.
5. Reduce the broth down to about 2/3 its original volume. Cool and store, this should last in the fridge for a couple days.

_serving_
1. Slice the remaining scallions super thin, so that they can be sprinkled on top of the dish.
2. Slice the remaining tomatoes like a pizza (into 8 slices each).
3. Chop the bok choy stem, so that the leaves can move freely.
4. Prepare the noodles and add them to the serving bowls.
5. Also add half a tomato per serving to each bowl.
6. Bring the broth to a boil. Should have about 3 cups per serving.
7. For each serving, add 3 tbsp soy sauce and 5 shakes of five spice powder. Add crushed red chili pepper to taste.
8. Add ~3ish chunks of beef to the broth per serving. Don't be stingy - it's the easiest way to ruin a bowl of 牛肉面.
9. Blanche the bok choy in the broth for ~1 minute. Pull out the beef chunks and bok choy into the serving bowls.
10. Pour the broth into the bowls for serving. Sprinkle scallions on top and enjoy!

</code></pre><h1 id=what-is-this-recipe>What is this recipe</h1><p>For those of you looking for a gourmet and authentic 牛肉面 this is probably not the web page you are looking for. I diverge a lot from the tradition in that I:</p><ul><li>.don&rsquo;t use much sodium aside from soy sauce</li><li>.use bones in addition to meat for the soup</li><li>.make the broth separate from the finished dish</li><li>.have simplified the ingredients list so it&rsquo;s easier to find at a local mart</li><li>.don&rsquo;t stir fry the ingredients before cooking</li></ul><p>I promise this recipe is good and tastes good, though I can&rsquo;t promise that it&rsquo;s authentic.</p><p><img src=/img/beef-noodle-soup.jpg alt="With spaghetti">
<strong>Figure 2. Mmmmmmmmmm</strong></p><h1 id=a-memory>A Memory</h1><p>My parents both worked when I was growing up which made it rare to have a home cooked meal that took any time to make. This was a shame, because my mother was a phenomenal cook - and the McDonalds, canned beans and spaghetti / butter we often ate couldn&rsquo;t compare to the dishes of Hunan and Taiwan that she had grown up eating. When we did have a fancy dinner, 牛肉面 (beef noodle soup) was often the dish of choice - but it wasn&rsquo;t until college that I truly fell in love with the dish.</p><p>It was a long weekend in the fall when my mom brought a bunch of containers of beef noodle soup that my housemates and I absolutely could not get enough of. Since then I&rsquo;ve tried many times to replicate the recipe to little avail. The root of the problem seemed to be that searching for asian recipes 10 years ago would likely net some trendy food blogger using French cooking techniques to try and replicate their local chinese restaurant. This recipe isn&rsquo;t by any means traditional, but I&rsquo;ve found it to be easy and delicious - and as much as possible replicates the warm happy feeling only 牛肉面 can bring.</p><h1 id=on-flavor>On Flavor</h1><p>Most of the failures that plague other beef noodle soup recipes usually come down to the meat or the broth. Anyone who&rsquo;s ever touched a wok can likely cook noodles decently, and almost nobody can mess up blanching bok choy. The issue is that the chinese cooking I&rsquo;m exposed to takes a much different approach with the broth and meat than western style cooking.</p><p>These issues generally result in a broth that is:</p><ul><li>.thinner than a piece of paper</li><li>.not chinese tasting, which does my head in</li></ul><p>The meat is almost always not tender enough (which is crazy to me, given how easy this is to do). This can often be found when you use an instapot to cook this dish, seriously cook anything but this dish in an instapot. Another thing you&rsquo;ll see is people skimping on the beef, which is absolutely something you should avoid.</p><p>These mistakes tend to leave the eater with a soup that isn&rsquo;t filling and honestly sometimes difficult to get through. I find that even more modern recipes from asian authors make these common mistakes - which I hope to address with this recipe.</p><p>Some good general rules of thumb for beef noodle soups that I like are:</p><ul><li>.use bones in your broth and cook it for a long time. this is the best way to give your soup some body</li><li>.for the love of god use some chinese spices in your soup. if you&rsquo;re seasoning with paprika and ground black pepper it&rsquo;s probably not gonna taste very chinese.</li><li>.cook the meat for a long, long time and save the tendons / ligaments because they&rsquo;re part of the dish too!</li><li>.do not use an instapot - the pressure puches the fat (flavor) out of your meat, which leaves for an unpleasant eating experience</li></ul><p>Now that I&rsquo;ve got that out of the way let&rsquo;s try to get on to the recipe.</p><h4><a href=https://abudlightlime.com>Back to Home</a></h4></div></div><footer class=container><hr class=soften><p><a href=https://gitlab.com/maxlefou/hugo.386>hugo.386 theme</a> |
