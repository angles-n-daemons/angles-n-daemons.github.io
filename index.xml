&lt;p>Each one of us is born out of the earth, raised and nourished by it like a plant. Like a poppy, the child sprouts out of the ground and grows, its five tendrils on its few branches reaching out and grasping for things every single moment until it expires. We wrap around each other without consent, like the young ivy strangles the aging oak. In a fit of rage or fear, this plant lashes out and then is stupified when its actions are reciprocated.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Orphanage</title><link>https://abudlightlime.com/posts/20240922-the-orphanage/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Sep 2024 12:52:36 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://abudlightlime.com/posts/20240922-the-orphanage/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="the-orphanage">The Orphanage&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Last night I dreamt that I had been working at an orphanage in Latin America. Like most charities in the world its mission was to achieve something of good, but just like everything in practice it felt imperfect, unright, greedy from the inside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One came upon the orphanage by driving deep into the jungle; taking the back roads, dirt-paved roads, gravel low-ways and hilly drive-ways until a rectangular, dirt parking lot, surrounded by green and brown trees was reached. A small path was cut out in the corner of this driveway with a sign indicating the destination in question at its mouth.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pipette Ragu, my italian dream</title><link>https://abudlightlime.com/posts/20230911-pipette-ragu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Sep 2023 16:03:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://abudlightlime.com/posts/20230911-pipette-ragu/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://abudlightlime.com/img/pipette-ragu.png" alt="Pipette Ragu, the Forma Pasta Factory classic">

&lt;p>Italian food has always held a small warm space in my heart. Something about the flavors, the textures, the apparent brightness in the food has been easy to fall into for most of my life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like lots of college students, pasta and sauce was a staple throughout my younger years and it took quite a while to feel comfortable making my own sauce. Like all people though, we change and part of that path for me has been a more thorough approach to my home cooking.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>musings on the take home technical interview</title><link>https://abudlightlime.com/posts/20230823-the-take-home-assignment/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2023 12:41:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://abudlightlime.com/posts/20230823-the-take-home-assignment/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="what-motivates-the-technical-take-home-test">What motivates the technical take home test?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The take home exercise is an interviewing practice that&amp;rsquo;s existed for a while. It&amp;rsquo;s been around for a while in the form of a case study, and I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it personally as an open ended development exercise. If completed well, it provides a great deal of insight into how the candidate works. Like any practice though, it isn&amp;rsquo;t without its drawbacks. Aside from the issues companies face like cheating[1], take home interviews can artificially limit the prospective talent pool, in addition to self-select for dishonest candidates.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>popSQL part 2: writing the sqlite database file</title><link>https://abudlightlime.com/posts/20230811-popsql-2-writing-database-files/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Aug 2023 10:26:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://abudlightlime.com/posts/20230811-popsql-2-writing-database-files/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="writing-out-what-we-read">Writing out what we read&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>My approach this time will be to start from the absolute bottom of the system, the file format. I chose this as a starting place because it&amp;rsquo;s easy to test in addition to being well documented. From there I&amp;rsquo;ll design a close-enough-to the source set of abstractions which are unit tested fairly comprehsively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before we write any code, let&amp;rsquo;s look at the directory for the code this section. You&amp;rsquo;ll notice a pager, node, cell, and a record in the backend - a util and dbfile in the src directory, a main file, and a test suite. At this point, we create any folders and &lt;code>__init__.py&lt;/code> files needed to support the structure. You&amp;rsquo;ll also notice a &lt;code>test.db&lt;/code> which we&amp;rsquo;ll create using sqlite itself, and ideally be parsing out using our own code by the end of this exercise.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>popSQL part 0: a DB education through reverse-engineering</title><link>https://abudlightlime.com/posts/20230803-popsql-0-recreating-sqlite/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Aug 2023 11:41:42 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://abudlightlime.com/posts/20230803-popsql-0-recreating-sqlite/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="a-liking-for-database-systems">A liking for database systems&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Databases have long been a special interest of mine. Since taking CS 445 Information Systems at UMass, I&amp;rsquo;ve held a unique curiosity for how databases were used and how they worked under the hood. I found topics like relational algebra fascinating, and I always enjoyed how clean SQL felt. I distinctly remember how enjoyable it was leafing through Michael Stonebraker&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://redbook.io">Red Book&lt;/a> and over time I developed a decent understanding about how to design, interact with and debug production databases.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>RBAC x ReBAC, a hybrid authorization model for big technology companies</title><link>https://abudlightlime.com/posts/20230217-rbac-and-rebac/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2023 15:12:30 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://abudlightlime.com/posts/20230217-rbac-and-rebac/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Note:&lt;/em> This article is an abandoned draft.

&lt;p>An application&amp;rsquo;s access-control scheme is an important part of ensuring safety within your business. Most companies I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with have employed an RBAC model to secure their internal applications, which has provides a good-enough set of restrictions and controls for employees. This model breaks down as the business gets more complex, as does ReBAC - a popular alternative to RBAC. The wikipedia page for ReBAC describes how it can be layered in conjunction with RBAC [citation needed], but the literature online is sparse on exactly how to go about doing so. In this article, I aim to describe an implementation for doing so using a concrete business use case.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A curious claim about advertising's effect on Google</title><link>https://abudlightlime.com/posts/20221204-googles-claim-on-advertising/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Dec 2022 17:07:42 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://abudlightlime.com/posts/20221204-googles-claim-on-advertising/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="google-is-it-worse-now-short-form">Google, is it worse now?

Ma&amp;#39;s Zha Jiang Mian
(Serves 6)

ingredients:
 - sauce
 - 2 tbsp vegetable oil
 - 1 scallion (finely diced)
 - 3 garlic cloves (finely minced)
 - 1/2 in cube ginger (finely minced)
 - 1lb ground pork (or turkey)
 - 2 heaping tbsp dou ban jiang (bean paste)
 - 2 heaping tbsp tian mian jiang (sweet bean paste)
 - 2 tsp shaoxing wine
 - 1/2 tomato (diced)
 - 1 cup greenbeans (diced)
 - 2 cup dry tofu (diced)
 - 2 cups water

 - serving
 - flour noodles (cooked)
 - sauce
 - scallions (diced)
 - cucumber (cut into little sticks)
 - scrambled egg (cut into ribbons)

instructions:
_sauce_
1. In a skillet over medium heat, fry the scallions and garlic for about 1 minute, until the oil is infused with the flavor.
2. Remove the scallions and garlic and add the pork. Brown and crumble - you want the pieces to be extra small.
3. Once the pork is sufficiently browned and crumbled, add in the dou ban jiang, tian mian jiang, and shaoxing wine and cook for 3 more minutes on high heat. You want some of the sauce to be browned as well for more flavor - but stir to ensure it doesn&amp;#39;t burn.
4. Add the tomato, green bean, tofu and water and bring the mixture to a simmer. Simmer for 30 minutes.

_serving_
1. Ensure the sauce is still hot from cooking - feel free to microwave if it&amp;#39;s gone cold.
2. Add some noodles to a bowl. Add 3 tablespoons (or more) of sauce on top of the noodles, and then the scallions, cucumbers and egg. Mix vigerously to incorperate the sauce and enjoy!

However, there still exist some quirks of its usage that any web developer should know before using it. This story tells of one of them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-happens-on-deployment">What happens on Deployment&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For anyone who knows kubernetes, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that service deployments are rolled out in sets of pods. Each time you deploy a new version of your application, the old deployment slowly scales down while the new one scales up. In a deployment, each request is likely to be routed to any given pod so that means for some period of time in a rollout, your service is going to serve two versions of code simultaneously.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>牛肉麵, Wai Po's Beef Noodle Soup</title><link>https://abudlightlime.com/posts/20211015-beef-noodle-soup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Oct 2021 23:17:32 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://abudlightlime.com/posts/20211015-beef-noodle-soup/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://abudlightlime.com/img/beef-noodle-soup-biang.jpg" alt="Taiwan&amp;rsquo;s treat in brooklyn">

Wai Po&amp;#39;s Beef Noodle Soup
(serves 6 people)

ingredients:
 - soup
 - 6 quarts water
 - 2 lbs beef chuck (cut into 1 inch cubes)
 - 1 lb beef marrow bones (optional)
 - 3 tbsp vegetable oil
 - 1 garlic bulb in cloves
 - 2 inch piece ginger (sliced)
 - 1 stalk of scallions (quartered)
 - 2 tbsp doubanjiang (spicy bean paste)
 - 1/2 cup light soy sauce
 - 1/2 cup dark soy sauce
 - 1/2 cup shaoxing (or sweet cooking) wine
 - 1 yellow onion (peeled and halved)
 - 1 large tomato (quartered)
 - 1/2 an apple (decored)
 - 4 star anise
 - 2 chinese cinnamon sticks
 - 2 oz rock sugar
 - serving
 - flour noodles (cooked)
 - baby bok choy (blanched)
 - sesame oil (optional)
 - scallion (sliced)
 - tomato (sliced
 - 1 pint soup (heated)

instructions:
_soup_
1. Bring 8 quarts of water to a boil. Blanche and rinse the beef bones / chuck in batches. Set them aside for now.
2. In a large pot on high heat, bring the vegetable oil to near the smoking point. Flash fry the ginger, garlic and scallions for roughly 1 minute.
3. Add the doubanjiang to the pot and continue stirring the mixture for 1-2 mins, trying not to burn the sauce.
 - *Note*: This step aresolizes the spice from the doubanjiang. Make sure to turn on your vent for this step.
4. Add the dark and light soy to the pot. Add the beef to the pot as well and mix thoroughly to coat the meat in the mixture. Let cook for another 3-4 minutes.
5. Add the 6 quarts of water and the cooking wine to the pot. Bring it up to a boil and then lower the heat to medium.
6. Let the soup cook for another 1-4 hours depending on how tender you want the beef to be. Make sure to add water periodically as the broth should be at a rolling boil.
7. In the last 30 minutes of the boil, add the apple and rock sugar to the soup.
8. Strain the soup into a serving or storage container. Set the beef aside and discard the rest of the stew materials.

_serving_
1. Ensure that the broth is either just hot from cooking, or being heated before mixing the ingredients.
2. In a pot of boiling water, cook the noodles to just before done and set aside.
3. Using that same pot of boiling water, blanche the bok choy (or other leafy green) and set aside.
4. In a large bowl, add the beef and noodles side by side. Drizzle a splash of sesame oil on top and add the broth, bok choy, tomato and scallions.

&lt;p>Case Interview (case study)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen this, but it sounds like you propose an engineeer with a business scenario and ask the interviewee to study the problem, perform an analysis and discuss the problem in person&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seems good for those who are able to break down business problems as well as communicate&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
