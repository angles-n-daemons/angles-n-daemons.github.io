I&rsquo;ve seen the good and the bad from both sides of the line, and after a somewhat uncomfortable recent interview I wanted to flush some of my stronger thoughts out to disk. At first I wanted to bring to light some criticisms on take-home projects, but after exploring my thoughts around this practice I found that there thoughts outside of it which I also wanted to share. With that in mind, I&rsquo;ve set out to talk about a variety of practices to screen someone&rsquo;s technical abilities. This doesn&rsquo;t take into account ways to make interivews approachable, or screening for non-technical traits that provide generous value.</p><h1 id=programming-exercises>programming exercises</h1><p>Data Structures and Algorithms provide a shared foundation that can be learned in a relatively short period of time. Absent this shared foundation, the overlap of skills between the interviewer and interviewee could be nil, and no signal could be gained.</p><h1 id=the-go-to-screening-process>The go to screening process</h1><p>Process that most organizations include is some number of programming exercises, and a system design portion</p><p>The cost for a mismatch? find citation</p><ul><li><p>The cursed programming exercise
Perhaps the most devisive in the industry, link to examples
I&rsquo;ve been cursed at in the middle of an interview</p><ul><li>Straightforward</li><li>Debugging</li><li>Algorithmic<ul><li>For this actually, the industry at this point has a pretty standard set of information that benefits candidates in this step. Complexity theory, data structures like trees, graphs, algorithms like searching, sorting, and often the flexitility to use language built-ins</li><li>Asking about fringe data structures is as unfair as asking about fringe language features, I wouldn&rsquo;t expect a candidate to know about bloom filters anymore than I would expect them to know the python VM instruction set.
talk about merits and drawbacks of square style interview
Can develop lots of problems, so that candidates cannot memorize all of them in preparation (prevents cheating)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>System Design</p><ul><li>Can introduce a bit of bias into the process. Where I&rsquo;ve seen this done, there wasn&rsquo;t necessarily a standardized rubric.</li><li>There&rsquo;s also a lot of room for alternative answers, which requires the interviewers to understand the possibilities much more than the candidates which isn&rsquo;t always the case. A BE engineer interviewing a FE engineer for a position may not gather that much signal on the depth and breadth of the FE engineer&rsquo;s skills</li><li>Programming exercises do generally have a small set of answers, and their optimiality is relatively clear. For system design, the answers can include lots of configurations of schema design, infrastructure components, data storage systems in a way that makes it difficult to gauge the optimality of the answer. Often how good the candidate is at convincing you the design is optimal is the measure rather than how it would handle a real world test</li></ul></li></ul><h1 id=the-take-home-project-signal-on-stilts>The take-home project, signal on stilts</h1><ul><li>Take Home Project
start with the good
Tons of signal in terms of the person&rsquo;s if it&rsquo;s done
Lots to dig into in how they design, write for readability, etc</li></ul><p>Lots of overhead, both for the company and the person taking the project home</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think many decent projects come back in two hours.</p><p>quote the artsy thing
quote the dropbox thing (stopped doing it because of lots of cheating)
tell story about my experience
asapp 2 weeks, python, javascript, sql schema files, bash scripts to get it running
mets 2 hours - debugging project setup, debugging csv library, reading the documentation on chartjs (which I&rsquo;ve used but not in conjunction with react)
ended with the create-react-app boiler plate, a text input, a couple data transformation functions, and a graph which showed nothing</p><p>The project which I worked on for asapp was much better than the one I worked on for the mets, but the engineer who would be working today is a much better engineer than the one who was working 6 years ago</p><p>What does it bias towards? People without worklife balance. Good for startups. To a degree. I feel like me working at 40 hours a week, is going to develop much better software than the me who would work 60 hours a week. herein lies the crux,</p><h1 id=the-technical-quiz-an-aside-on-a-slowly-fading-practice-on-interviewing>The technical quiz, an aside on a slowly fading practice on interviewing</h1><ul><li>For senior engineers, can really highlight their depth and breadth of knowledge</li><li>For junior engineers, this can be really hit or miss.</li></ul><p>Rote, doesn&rsquo;t actually gage skill in applying
