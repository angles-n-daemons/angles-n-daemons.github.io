**Figure 1. This dish saved me from a rough, rough darkness

In June of 2022, I struggled through a patch of anxiety unlike anything I can remember. I was unable to sleep, eat, sit still, or even look my loved ones in the eyes. It was a horribly dark period in my life. While struggling through the throes of this battle with my mind, I stumbled upon Forma Pasta Factory's Pipette Ragu, a dish I had had before, but never like this. For a few beautiful hours, I gained peace from my mind and heart; peace granted by the solace provided by the gentle chefs at this restaurant.

Time and time again I've gone back to relive this dish and it hasn't once failed to inspire my heart to movement. After enough time I decided to try to cook it myself.

The recipe itself isn't exactly publicly available, nor are any similar creations readily available online. If you look for a "Pipette Ragu" online, you're certain to find some tomato sauce recipe. If you look at the Forma Pasta Factory menu, you'll see an ambiguous "herbal cream sauce" as the primary coating, and recipes online for things similarly named vary wildly in presentation and contents.

I spoke with the employees at Forma and they did give some good information. Clues like "a white wine", "homemade sausage" and "cooking the sausage in the sauce" helped me greatly narrow down how I would approach cooking it. Watching the chefs spoon the solidified sauce, mix it with pasta water, fry it and garnish it also helped me form understandings as to how I would store it and how I would prepare it. Using all the things mentioned I came up with this recipe:

```
Sausage Mix
- Fennel Bulb 1/2 cup chopped
- Onion 1/2 cup chopped
- Hot Italian Sausage .5lbs uncased

Ragu Sauce
- white wine 1/2 cup
- garlic 4 cloves chopped
- tomato paste 1 tbsp

- heavy cream 1 cup
- chicken broth 1/2 cup
- parmesean cheese 1/2 cup

- thyme 1/2 teaspoon
- dill 1/2 teaspoon
- basil 1 teaspoon chopped

Garnish
- parmesean cheese
- chopped parsley
- black pepper
```
