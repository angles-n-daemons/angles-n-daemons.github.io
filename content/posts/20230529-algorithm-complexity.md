# Overview

Understanding how your code scales is an important part of the programming interviewing process. While the merits of having it in interviews is debated, there's no question that having some understanding of complexity theory is generally benficial when conducting a job search. With that in mind, I wanted to describe what I think would be important about complexity theory for any technical candidate.

This document will go into:
 * The terminology used in complexity theory
 * A descriptive rundown of various complexity classes
 * Some additional information on how to use complexity classes
 * How to approach discussing complexity in an interview
 * A quick set of practice problems to familiarize yourself with complexity theory

# Terminology
- Describe what n is
  - Use code to show this
- Talk about O notation
  - Commonly referred to as Big-O
  - Looks like O(<complexity class>)
  - It's worst case
- Complexity class (what the heck is this called)

# Complexity Classes
- Constant
- Show how
- Logrithmic
- Linear
- Quadratic
- Cubic and Beyond

# Additional information
- Some more info
  - you don't need all termsThe least you should know about algorithmic complexity"
    - Example with linear and quadratic
  - If you multiply by a constant, you can remove the constant
- Multiple sizes for the input

# Graph

- Allows you to check different complexities
- Gives a description in the differences
- Shows divergence from some small number to some large number

# Quiz on complexities

- Example one, linear
- Finding duplicates
  - Quadratic
  - Linear
