# Humanity

Each one of us is born out of the earth, raised and nourished by it like a plant. Like a poppy, the child sprouts out of the ground and grows, its five tendrils on its few branches reaching and grasping for things until it expires. Each of us wraps around each other without consent, like the young ivy strangles the aging oak. In a fit of rage or fear, the plant lashes out and then is stupified when its actions are paid back. We get no closer to peace, mental health is the only uncrackable frontier of science.

Through research, development and ingenuity, we can each year extract more value into a single kilogram of earth. It seems however, that despite our best efforts, that no amount of science can change the amount of misery we can remove from a similar kilogram of the human soul.

Each of us tries however, struggling against each other in the proverbial rat race. To distract ourselves, we fall in love with movie stars, we have sex with our phones. We buy plastic plants, none of us seeming to notice the irony of that action. We sing our songs, here is the tale of Manchester United, of the Baltimore Ravens, and here, in this stadium, is my eternity.

And we take with us a pacifier everywhere we go. We place it in our ears and we escape from where we are, a car ride, a train, our own homes. Should the stream of delusion from our airpods be interrupted, we cry out in agony, unfamiliar with the intolerable silence of reality.

And each of us returns to the earth, with force and unwilling submission. The sage, despite his years of practice, gasps his last breath with the same desperation as the undiciplined alcoholic. And none of us can find a satisfying reason as to why things are this way.
