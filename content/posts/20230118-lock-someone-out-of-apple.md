## Do you want to ruin someone's year?

Have you ever wondered how difficult it would be to steal someone's identity? Do you have any interest in pulling money directly out of their bank accounts and tricking their friends into worrying about them and sending you cash? Do you want to prevent them from doing anything about it, and to have an infinite amount of time to drain them of security?

You’d probably mumble something about not being a hacker, or mention the risk of diving through someone’s trash. No need to fear, as today Apple makes it as easy as borrowing a phone off the street. 2FA be damned, with Apple’s magnificent authentication technology you only need to ask someone to make a phone call.

## How to do it

Here’s what you’re going to need to do. Find someone off the street with an iPhone, anyone will do. Tell them to you need to make a call to a family member and say your phone is dead. Feel free to show it to them as a fake gesture of sincerity. Make sure to take the phone before they enter the pin, and then ask for it when you go to make the call. With their phone and their pin in your possession, you now own the keys to the kingdom! Feel free to stroll around the block for “better service” or just hoof it out of there.

Now the pesky little ant you just fried is going to try to save their account since you’ve gained access to their lives. That’s no issue, you just need to do three quick things:

1. Change the password on the account. This should be easy, because the change is gated by a phone notification which you have access to. Even funnier is that the flow to reset your password defaults to this, so if the owner of the phone tries you’ll likely be able to intercept it.
2. Remove other authenticated Apple devices from the account. If they have a laptop or ipad attached to the account, you’re going to want to remove them otherwise you might have a skirmish for control. Not to worry though, you have a headstart as you’re holding the primary device on the account.
3. Change the trusted phone number to another number you can use. After this is done, there’s no way for the person to get back into the account.

Congrats, now they’re locked out forever! Apple has no form of recourse from this situation, you just gained access to this person’s digital identity, and likely a bigger portion of it than you would have expected.

## What does this do for me?

Now that that’s over with you can take your time doing things like:

1. Steal money from them. 
2. Make some big ass purchases* with Apple Pay. Really great stuff that they’re encouraging people to enroll in this. Right now they’re probably still on a call with Apple Support (and will be for the next few hours till they realize there’s nothing that can be done!)
3. Get their social security number. Images, notes and email are good starting points. To see how easy this is, type the first three digits of your social into your email’s search bar and see what comes up!
4. Trick their friends into meeting you or sending you money. Now that you have access to iMessage, you can send messages directly to them as if you're this person, blue bubble confidence and all!
5. Track the locations of their loved ones using Find My. It’ll be a couple days before they can figure out how to notify everyone their phone has been compromised.
6. Share their private photos with anyone and everyone you care. If it helps you get more money you can probably just blackmail them with these.

You don’t need to be a computer hacker, digital sleuth, or anything else of the nature, you just have to be able to operate an iPhone which (number) of people use every day.

## Are they really locked out?

Over the past years, Apple has shifted a lot of its security controls into trusted devices and phone numbers. For pretty much every flow that you could possibly imagine to regain access to the account, there’s the following:


1. A notification sent out to the device on the account
2. Controls to allow the person with the device to block any attempts to regain control

Let’s go over some use cases suggested from the Apple Support documents:

### Try to reset or unlock your account
