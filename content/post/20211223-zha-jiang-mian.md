炸醬麵
Ma's Zha Jiang Mian
(Serves 6)

ingredients:
 - sauce
   - 2 tbsp vegetable oil
   - 1 scallion (finely diced)
   - 3 garlic cloves (finely minced)
   - 1/2 in cube ginger (finely minced)
   - 1lb ground pork (or turkey)
   - 2 heaping tbsp dou ban jiang (bean paste)
   - 2 heaping tbsp tian mian jiang (sweet bean paste)
   - 1/2 tomato (diced)
   - 1 cup greenbeans (diced)
   - 2 cup dry tofu (diced)
   - 2 cups water

 - serving
   - flour noodles (cooked)
   - sauce
   - scallions (diced)
   - cucumber (cut into little sticks)
   - scrambled egg (cut into ribbons)

instructions:
_sauce_
1. In a skillet over medium heat, fry the scallions and garlic for about 1 minute, until the oil is infused with the flavor.
2. Remove the scallions and garlic and add the pork. Brown and crumble - you want the pieces to be extra small.
3. Once the pork is sufficiently browned and crumbled, add in the dou ban jiang and tian mian jiang and cook for 3 more minutes on high heat. You want some of the sauce to be browned as well for more flavor - but stir to ensure it doesn't burn.
4. Add the tomato, green bean, tofu and water and bring the mixture to a simmer. Simmer for 30 minutes.

_serving_
1. Ensure the sauce is still hot from cooking - feel free to microwave if it's gone cold.
2. Add some noodles to a bowl. Add 3 tablespoons (or more) of sauce on top of the noodles, and then the scallions, cucumbers and egg. Mix vigerously to incorperate the sauce and enjoy!
