长岛牛肉面
the long island beef noodle soup
(serves 9 people or 40 hungry cats)

ingredients:
 - 10 quarts water
 - 6 lbs beef bones
 - 2-3 lbs beef chuck
 - 6 tbsp sugar (optional)
 - baby bok choy (to your liking)
 - 5 tomatoes
 - 2 stalks scallions
 - five spice powder
 - crushed red chili powder
 - soy sauce
 - flour noodles (or spaghetti)

instructions:
_broth & meat_
1. Bring 10 quarts of water to a boil. Blanche, rinse and set aside the beef bones & chuck. Discard dirty water.
2. Bring 10 more quarts of water and optionally the sugar to a boil. Add the beef bones and chuck in addition to two quartered tomatoes and one stalk of scallions.
3. Boil on medium for 2 hours, then pull the bones and chuck out and prepare / set aside meat.
  3a. For the bones, try to pull the tendons and ligaments off in addition to any meat that's attached.
  3b. Cut the chuck into 1.5-2" wide cubes. They should be larger than bite sized, but movable with chop sticks.
4. Return the bones only to the broth and continue to boil for at least another 6 hours. Add water as needed.
5. Reduce the broth down to about 2/3 its original volume. Cool and store, this should last in the fridge for a couple days.

_serving_
1. Slice the remaining scallions super thin, so that they can be sprinkled on top of the dish.
2. Slice the remaining tomatoes like a pizza (into 8 slices).
3. Chop the bok choy stem, so that the leaves can move freely.
4. Prepare the noodles and add them to the serving bowls.
5. Also add half a tomato per serving to each bowl.
6. Bring the broth to a boil. Should have about 3 cups per serving.
7. For each serving, add 4 tbsp soy sauce and 5 shakes of five spice powder. Add crushed red chili pepper to taste.
8. Add ~3ish chunks of beef to the broth per serving. Don't be stingy - it's the easiest way to ruin a bowl of 牛肉面.
9. Blanche the bok choy in the broth for ~1 minute. Pull out the beef chunks and bok choy into the serving bowls.
10. Pour the broth into the bowls for serving. Sprinkle scallions on top and enjoy!
