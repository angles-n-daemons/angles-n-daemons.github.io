Spend less time rubbernecking.</title><link>https://abudlightlime.com/posts/20220703-rubberneck-debugging/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 16:26:50 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://abudlightlime.com/posts/20220703-rubberneck-debugging/</guid><description>What is rubberneck debugging? Rubberneck debugging is something I see a lot of high achieving engineers fall trap to. Put simply, it’s the eagerness one might feel to respond to urgent inquiries in a forum like slack. I find that it tends to stifle the engineers growth, as well as diminishes the opportunities that newer and more junior engineers have to engage in public discussion.

I found this helpful guide](https://brianjenney.medium.com/how-to-survive-your-first-on-call-rotation-as-a-software-engineer-5bc0d334566e) detailing a lot of the ideas I share, and hope that this document can serve as an affirmation and compliment to that one.
