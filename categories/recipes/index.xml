&lt;strong>Figure 1. This dish has brought me more joy than I can easily recount.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Italian food has always held a small warm space in my heart. Something about the flavors, the textures, the apparent brightness in the food has been easy to fall into for most of my life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like lots of college students, pasta and sauce was a staple throughout my younger years and it took quite a while to feel comfortable making my own sauce. Like all people though, we change and part of that path for me has been a more thorough approach to my home cooking.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Bacon Egg and Cheese, New York's Real Treasure</title><link>https://abudlightlime.com/posts/20220302-bacon-egg-and-cheese/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2022 21:04:10 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://abudlightlime.com/posts/20220302-bacon-egg-and-cheese/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://abudlightlime.com/img/bec-final.jpg" alt="A full long island breakfast">

&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>炸醬麵
Ma&amp;#39;s Zha Jiang Mian
(Serves 6)

ingredients:
 - sauce
 - 2 tbsp vegetable oil
 - 1 scallion (finely diced)
 - 3 garlic cloves (finely minced)
 - 1/2 in cube ginger (finely minced)
 - 1lb ground pork (or turkey)
 - 2 heaping tbsp dou ban jiang (bean paste)
 - 2 heaping tbsp tian mian jiang (sweet bean paste)
 - 2 tsp shaoxing wine
 - 1/2 tomato (diced)
 - 1 cup greenbeans (diced)
 - 2 cup dry tofu (diced)
 - 2 cups water

 - serving
 - flour noodles (cooked)
 - sauce
 - scallions (diced)
 - cucumber (cut into little sticks)
 - scrambled egg (cut into ribbons)

instructions:
_sauce_
1. In a skillet over medium heat, fry the scallions and garlic for about 1 minute, until the oil is infused with the flavor.
2. Remove the scallions and garlic and add the pork. Brown and crumble - you want the pieces to be extra small.
3. Once the pork is sufficiently browned and crumbled, add in the dou ban jiang, tian mian jiang, and shaoxing wine and cook for 3 more minutes on high heat. You want some of the sauce to be browned as well for more flavor - but stir to ensure it doesn&amp;#39;t burn.
4. Add the tomato, green bean, tofu and water and bring the mixture to a simmer. Simmer for 30 minutes.

_serving_
1. Ensure the sauce is still hot from cooking - feel free to microwave if it&amp;#39;s gone cold.
2. Add some noodles to a bowl. Add 3 tablespoons (or more) of sauce on top of the noodles, and then the scallions, cucumbers and egg. Mix vigerously to incorperate the sauce and enjoy!

&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>紅燒牛肉麵
Wai Po&amp;#39;s Beef Noodle Soup
(serves 6 people)

ingredients:
 - soup
 - 6 quarts water
 - 2 lbs beef chuck (cut into 1 inch cubes)
 - 1 lb beef marrow bones (optional)
 - 3 tbsp vegetable oil
 - 1 garlic bulb in cloves
 - 2 inch piece ginger (sliced)
 - 1 stalk of scallions (quartered)
 - 2 tbsp doubanjiang (spicy bean paste)
 - 1/2 cup light soy sauce
 - 1/2 cup dark soy sauce
 - 1/2 cup shaoxing (or sweet cooking) wine
 - 1 yellow onion (peeled and halved)
 - 1 large tomato (quartered)
 - 1/2 an apple (decored)
 - 4 star anise
 - 2 chinese cinnamon sticks
 - 2 oz rock sugar
 - serving
 - flour noodles (cooked)
 - baby bok choy (blanched)
 - sesame oil (optional)
 - scallion (sliced)
 - tomato (sliced
 - 1 pint soup (heated)

instructions:
_soup_
1. Bring 8 quarts of water to a boil. Blanche and rinse the beef bones / chuck in batches. Set them aside for now.
2. In a large pot on high heat, bring the vegetable oil to near the smoking point. Flash fry the ginger, garlic and scallions for roughly 1 minute.
3. Add the doubanjiang to the pot and continue stirring the mixture for 1-2 mins, trying not to burn the sauce.
 - *Note*: This step aresolizes the spice from the doubanjiang. Make sure to turn on your vent for this step.
4. Add the dark and light soy to the pot. Add the beef to the pot as well and mix thoroughly to coat the meat in the mixture. Let cook for another 3-4 minutes.
5. Add the 6 quarts of water and the cooking wine to the pot. Bring it up to a boil and then lower the heat to medium.
6. Let the soup cook for another 1-4 hours depending on how tender you want the beef to be. Make sure to add water periodically as the broth should be at a rolling boil.
7. In the last 30 minutes of the boil, add the apple and rock sugar to the soup.
8. Strain the soup into a serving or storage container. Set the beef aside and discard the rest of the stew materials.

_serving_
1. Ensure that the broth is either just hot from cooking, or being heated before mixing the ingredients.
2. In a pot of boiling water, cook the noodles to just before done and set aside.
3. Using that same pot of boiling water, blanche the bok choy (or other leafy green) and set aside.
4. In a large bowl, add the beef and noodles side by side. Drizzle a splash of sesame oil on top and add the broth, bok choy, tomato and scallions.
