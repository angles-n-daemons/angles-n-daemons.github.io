&lt;p>Each one of us is born out of the earth, raised and nourished by it like a plant. Like a poppy, the child sprouts out of the ground and grows, its five tendrils on its few branches reaching and grasping for things until it expires. Each of us wraps around each other without consent, like the young ivy strangles the aging oak. In a fit of rage or fear, the plant lashes out and then is stupified when its actions are paid back. We get no closer to peace, mental health is the only uncrackable frontier of science.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
